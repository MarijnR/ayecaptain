<h1>Éclairs</h1>
	<p>Get to grips with choux pastry to make the ultimate teatime treat: delicious chocolate éclairs.
Equipment and preparation: you will need a piping bag fitted with the small, plain nozzle.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<!--ul>.item*5 -->
	<ul>
		<li class="item">100g/3½oz plain flour or strong white flour</li>
		<li class="item">pinch salt</li>
		<li class="item">75g/2½oz butter</li>
		<li class="item">4 free-range eggs</li>
		<li class="item">200g/7oz icing sugar</li>
		<li class="item">25g/1oz cocoa powder</li>
		<li class="item">50g/1¾oz icing sugar, sifted</li>
		<li class="item">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
		<li class="item">400ml/14fl oz whipped cream, whipped volume (about 200ml/7fl oz unwhipped double cream)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Preperation method dit werkt</h2>
	<ul>
		<li class="item">For the pastry, sift the flour and a pinch of salt into a large bowl and set aside.</li>
		<li class="item">Put 150ml/5½fl oz water and the butter into a saucepan set over a medium-high heat and stir until the butter melts. Allow the mixture to come to a rolling boil, then immediately remove the pan from the heat.</li>
		<li class="item">Add the flour and salt and beat very well with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together.</li>
		<li class="item">Reduce the heat to medium and replace the saucepan over the heat. Stir for a minute until the mixture starts to slightly stick to the base of the pan. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for a minute.</li>
		<li class="item">Beat three eggs together and pour about one-quarter of the beaten egg into the pan. Using the wooden spoon, beat very well until incorporated. Add a little more egg and beat well again until the mixture comes back together. Continue to add the egg, beating vigorously all the time, until the mixture has softened, is nice and shiny and has a dropping consistency. You may not need to add all the egg or you may need a little extra. If the mixture is too stiff (not enough egg) then the choux pastries will be too heavy, but if the mixture is too wet (too much egg), they will not hold their shape when spooned onto baking paper.</li>
